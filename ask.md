You can get quality data that correctly propagates to your accounting, sales and/or manufacturing departments in real time. 

I am building something and want to better understand the costs

We're building something too. And tackling the various ways to slice that data is hard but insightful. Our software of choice, ERPNext, has many ways to do this and allows you to identify a range of "denominators" to analyze yours costs: per project, per order and per
